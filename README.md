# Machine learning

## ML

- Supervised learning: the data require for labels, to classify the outputs.
- Unsupervised learning: the input allows to make groups and get information of the data.
- Reinforcement learning: data can be grouped and search patterns. and take actions to maximize the reward.

### Terms

- Artificial intelligence(AI): refers to the ability of a machine to perform tasks that require human intelligence, and to make the machine perform the task at the same level that a human or better.

- Machine learning(ML): ai subfield which involves giving machines the ability to perform a specific task without the need for it to be explicitly programmed to perform it.

- Deep learning: is a type of ML that uses artificial neural networks that can learn and make associations between nodes to give an output from an input, this process simulates the human brain.

- Label(y): the prediction.
- Feature(x): a input variable.
- Model: define a relationship between features and labels.
- Training: give a dataset at the model and allow that the model learn with the data with label.
- Inference: use the model for predictions.
